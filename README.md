## Project Content

This repository contains slides and samples for my *Cargo Introduction* session. It was originally created for a talk at the [Rust Linz meetup](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Rust-Linz/events/271857182/) on Aug. 6th 2020.

## Slides

The slides are based on Markdown and [revealjs](https://revealjs.com/).

The slides are [available online](https://rstropek.github.io/CargoIntro/). If you want to run the slides locally, perform the following steps:

* Clone this repository
* `npm install`
* `npm start`

## Samples

You find the samples for the session in the [*samples*](samples) folder. Each samples contains a hands-on lab readme file that you can use to practice various Rust and Cargo topics. The slides contain links to the hands-on labs.
